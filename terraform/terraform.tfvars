Credentials are automatically detected from standard AWS authentication means:
 - AWS creds file used with AWS CLI (~/.aws/credentials)
 - Environment variables (AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETACCESSKEY)
 - IAM Roles (preferred for EC2, ECS)
 - AWS SSO (aws sso login)
If none of these are available to you, you can provide the credentials directly below (uncomment access_key, secret_key and provide values).
!!! However this is considered a security anti-pattern. !!!
For more documentation on how to authenticate, reference the link below:
